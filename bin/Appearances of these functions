Where do these functions appear in the code?


besmuddle_data -- in main.m with user input (1/2/3, data) adds some intentional baseline to model

celledit -- in Lmodel.m, Gmodel.m, GLmodel.m to enable blockwise (de-)activation of optimization parameters

findMinima2 -- (was replaced by successor) in Spliner.m as the actual function determining the peaks in .findInitPeakInfo in findStartSpec4 with

findMinima3 -- (replaced predecessor) in Spliner.m as the actual function determining the peaks in .findInitPeakInfo in findStartSpec4 

findStartSpec4 -- in Spliner.m as the peak-determining function in .findInitPeakInfo

my_closereq -- in Lmodel.m, Gmodel.m, GLmodel.m as a certain closing operator for the parameter GUI in .showpara

mysg -- same as sg, but used and easier to understand

mysgfilt -- same as sgfilt, but used and easier to understand

Phase_corrections_test -- unused, but gives information on how to besmuddle data with incorrect phasing

compare_results -- unused in main, only used for comparisons in sigtrack-paper

prob_test2 -- currently unused predecessor of

prob_test3 -- in Spliner.m, aids in creating probable peak positions for optimization variants

ResVec -- currently unused, sums up rows of model.RES to presumably lower dimensions

smuddlephase_data -- in main.m with user input (1/2/3, data) phases data intentionally incorrectly

SplineGridGUI_bunt -- in main.m with user input finds Tsidx, special time layers for spline knots

wasserstein -- in Spliner.m, provides an extra metric for model quality, calculates Wasserstein-metric
