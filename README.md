# nmr_timeseries_model
Code for "Using Machine Learning to Improve the Hard Modeling of NMR Time Series" paper

Version requirements: Matlab 2021b or later, Python 3.8.10 or later

Getting started: Run main.m to get a quick glance at the program. If you want to use machine learning, define the correct path of the virtual environment which knows torch and numpy

Loading data sets: Requires a phase and baseline-corrected data set as a .mat file. The file should contain 3 different variables.
 -- The data, called 'd' or 'D'
 -- The frequency axis, called 'x' or 'X'
 -- The time axis, called 't' or 'T'.

 Then, create new file for loading data, which can be copied and pasted from existing files and add it to file section in main.m.

 Set hyperparameters in options section (not necessary, but incorrect definition of hyperparamters leads to incorrect results).

 Then, run main in desired variant.

 Results can be saved, if 'opt.isSaveFile = 1;'
